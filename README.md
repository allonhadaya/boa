===========================================================================

Inspiration
-----------

I like weekly acupuncture.  
I have a bad memory, and forget to book appointments.  
I wrote a program to book appointments for me automatically in advance.  

Future Work
-----------

* [ ] don't book an earlier appointment if you've already got one that day
* [ ] integration with google calendar
* [ ] generalize the kinds of schedules that can be booked
* [ ] provide instructions on configuration and installation
